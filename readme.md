# 🚀 NLP Command Executor

## 📌 Introduction
NLP Command Executor is a powerful **Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool** that simplifies terminal command execution using **natural language prompts**. Instead of memorizing complex commands, simply describe your task in plain English, and the tool will map it to the appropriate terminal command. 

### 🎯 Why Use NLP Command Executor?
- **Faster and More Intuitive**: No need to remember long terminal commands.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Ideal for users unfamiliar with command-line interfaces.
- **Secure**: Includes validation to prevent dangerous command execution.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean, easy-to-navigate GUI.
